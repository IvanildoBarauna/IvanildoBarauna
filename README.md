## About me          

I am a Data Analytics professional with extensive experience in producing and consuming data, specializing in the end-to-end journey of data as a product to generate actionable business insights. Throughout my career, I have worked as a BI Analyst, Data Analyst, and Data & Analytics Engineer, focusing on Data Visualization, ETL, Data Modeling, and leveraging technologies such as Google Cloud Platform, Google BigQuery, Apache Beam, AirFlow, SQL, Power BI, and Looker Studio.

Currently, I work as a software and data engineer, developing data solutions. In my free time, I contribute to the Open Source community by creating libraries for Python developers, building end-to-end data applications, and advancing observability practices with OpenTelemetry, distributing these solutions through GitHub Packages and Google Cloud Platform.
